# V1alpha1UIFeatureFlag

Configures Tilt to enable non-default features (e.g., experimental or deprecated).  The Tilt features controlled by this are generally in an unfinished state, and not yet documented.  As a Tilt user, you donâ€™t need to worry about this unless something else directs you to (e.g., an experimental feature doc, or a conversation with a Tilt contributor).
